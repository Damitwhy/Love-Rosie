# Love Rosie Project

This project is a website built from Code Institutes course work, and is one part of my modules.

Love Rosie is a static personal resume website aimed at promoting Rosie's career in Full-Stack development.

Initially Rosie wanted a site to make her CV available to potential employers, with some additions of work history, social networking and UX orientated design the site now has information targeting her audience and shows off a little of her skills in Html and CSS at the same time.

## Why build the site in the first place?

It was important to Rosie to create a resume website because it allows her to showcase her skills, work experience, and projects in a visually appealing and easily accessible way. 

Having a dedicated website also gives Rosie a professional online presence, making it easier for potential employers to find and evaluate her qualifications. Additionally, a resume website allows Rosie to demonstrate her proficiency in web development by creating a personalized and well-designed site.
